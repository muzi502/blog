> I'm a single atheist white man, 55, reputedly intelligent, with unusual interests in politics, science, music and dance.
> I'd like to meet a woman with varied interests, curious about the world, comfortable expressing her likes and dislikes (I hate struggling to guess), delighting in her ability to fascinate a man and in being loved tenderly, who values joy, truth, beauty and justice more than "success"--so we can share bouts of intense, passionately kind awareness of each other, alternating with tolerant warmth while we're absorbed in other aspects of life.
> My 25-year-old child, the Free Software Movement, occupies most of my life, leaving no room for more children, but I still have room to love a sweetheart if she doesn't need to spend time with me every day. I spend a lot of my time traveling to give speeches, often to Europe, Asia and Latin America; it would be nice if you were free to travel with me some of the time.

我，单身，无神论者，白人，52岁，据说比较聪明，对于政治、科学、音乐和舞蹈有着不同寻常的兴趣。

我想寻找这样一位女士：爱好广泛，对世界充满好奇心，能够清晰表达她的爱憎（我痛恨动脑筋猜测），乐于使男人着迷，渴望被温柔地爱，对于快乐、真理、美和正义的评价高于“成功”。这样的话，我们就能不断对另一方产生热烈而又美好的了解，当我们被生活中其他东西吸引的时候，彼此就能感到宽容的温暖。

我有一个22岁的孩子——自由软件运动——他占据了我大部分的生活，没有精力再抚养更多的孩子了，但是我仍然会投入的爱我的爱人。我有大量时间花在巡回演讲上，经常要去欧洲、亚洲和拉丁美洲。如果你有空在某些时间陪我一起旅行，那就好了。

如果你有兴趣的话，请写信到 rms@stallman.org ，让我们看看会有什么结果
